          <p>
            The content of our website has been compiled with meticulous care
            and to the best of our knowledge. However, we cannot assume any
            liability for the up-to-dateness, completeness or accuracy of any of

            Pursuant to section 7, para. 1 of the TMG (Telemediengesetz – Tele
            Media Act by German law), we as service providers are liable for our
            own content on these pages in accordance with general laws. However,
            pursuant to sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, we as service providers are
            not under obligation to monitor external information provided or
            stored on our website. Once we have become aware of a specific
            infringement of the law, we will immediately remove the content in
            question. Any liability concerning this matter can only be assumed
            from the point in time at which the infringement becomes known to
            us.

            Our website contains links to the websites of third parties
            (“external links”). As the content of these websites is not under
            our control, we cannot assume any liability for such external

            websites is liable for the content and accuracy of the information
            provided. At the point in time when the links were placed, no
            infringements of the law were recognisable to us. As soon as an
            infringement of the law becomes known to us, we will immediately
            remove the link in question.

            We would like to expressly point out that the transmission of data
            via the Internet (e.g., by e-mail) can offer security

            completely against access by third parties. We cannot assume any
