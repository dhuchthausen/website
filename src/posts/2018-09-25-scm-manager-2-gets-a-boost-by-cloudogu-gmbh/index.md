In 2010 I started the development of SCM-Manager.  Since 2013 I have a strong partner: [Cloudogu GmbH](https://cloudogu.com). In the past they contributed to the project by helping with support cases and the development of several plug-ins like Groupmanager, CAS, scm-htpasswd and Checkstyle.

Because of many feature requests that cannot be realized with SCM-Manager 1, I decided to start the ambitious “SCM-Manager 2” project. Unfortunately, over time I realized that it is too much work to provide support for SCM-Manager 1 and to develop SCM-Manager 2 at the same time. Now, after four years of collaboration, [Cloudogu](https://cloudogu.com) and I decided that it was time to concentrate more power on the development of SCM-Manager 2, because we want it to play an important role in [Cloudogu EcoSystem](https://cloudogu.com).

Thanks to this collaboration, the development of SCM-Manager 2 will speed up. Moreover we will be able to ensure a permanent development of SCM-Manager and the community support as you know it.

I would also like to thank you, the community, because SCM-Manager would not be the same without you. Thanks to all your feature requests, bug reports and enhancements helped me to improve it.  So be asured, SCM-Manager is and will always be Open Source.

So stay tuned! There are a lot of interesting things going on!
