As mentioned [here](https://www.scm-manager.org/scm-manager-2/migration-to-github/),Â we migrated the scm-manager core repository to GitHub: [scm-manager/scm-manager](https://github.com/scm-manager/scm-manager).

We decided to do so due to the removed mercurial support from Bitbucket. This is no statement whatsoever against Mercurial, we will continue to support Mercurial, Git and Subversion.

- We migrated the entire code base from Mercurial to Git
- The Bitbucket Wiki is now located in the [docs](https://github.com/scm-manager/scm-manager/blob/develop/docs) folder of the repository
- All [issues](https://github.com/scm-manager/scm-manager/issues) have been migrated
