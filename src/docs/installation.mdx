### Quickstart

```text
docker run --name scm -p 8080:8080 -v scm-home:/var/lib/scm scmmanager/scm-manager:2.0.0-rc5
```

### Persistence

It is recommended to create a persistent volume for the scm-manager home directory.
This allows scm-manager updates and recreation of the container without lose of data.
The home directory is located at `/var/lib/scm`.
It is recommended to use a volume managed by docker. 
If it is required to use a host directory, keep in mind that the scm-manager process is executed with a user which has the id 1000.
So ensure that the user with the uid 1000 can write to the directory e.g.:

```text
mkdir /scm_home
chown 1000:1000 /scm_home
docker run --name scm -p 8080:8080 -v /scm_home:/var/lib/scm scmmanager/scm-manager:2.0.0-rc5
```

### Exposed Ports

SCM-Manager exposes its http port on port 8080.
If you want to use the ssh plugin, keep in mind that this plugin requires an extra port (default is 2222).

```text
docker run --name scm -p 2222:2222 -p 8080:8080 -v scm-home:/var/lib/scm scmmanager/scm-manager:2.0.0-rc5
```
