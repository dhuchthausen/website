The following SCM-Manager pages has been moved to a new server:

- www.scm-manager.org
- download.scm-manager.org
- docs.scm-manager.org
- maven.scm-manager.org
- plugins.scm-manager.org

This move was necessary to be prepared for the release 1.39 of SCM-Manager. Version 1.39 is the first release which will be delivered as <a title="RPM" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPM</a> and <a title="DEB" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEB</a> linux packages. To deliver those packages we will create a <a title="YUM" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YUM</a> repository and an <a title="APT" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APT</a> repository on the new server.
