SCM-Manager has its own <a title="SCM-Manager Universe" href="https://www.scm-manager.org/scm-manager-2/scm-manager-gets-its-own-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universe</a>. There it acts in the center of a bundle of ready to use open source software components.

Now the virtual appliance SCM-Manager Universe, which is developed by my partner TRIOLOGY, is available as a Cloud-Service. This highly scalable, most secure and deeply integrated Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) makes developing software even easier.

Try out this new service completely for free and without commitment!
