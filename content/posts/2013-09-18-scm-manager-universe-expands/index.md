The first update for SCM-Manager Universe is available now. It has its focus on improving code quality by integrating the widely known code quality management tool “SonarQube” and the scm-checkstyle-plugin into the appliance. Now the programmer automatically gets the build results in Jenkins and the code analysis results in SonarQube after he pushed changes to SCM-Manager. SonarQube is integrated into the SCM-Manager Universe infrastructure e.g. LDAP and backup. Besides that all reasonable updates of tools were performed.
