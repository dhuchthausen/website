The first is the [scm-pathwp-plugin](https://bitbucket.org/sdorra/scm-pathwp-plugin), this plugin enables path write protection for repositories. The second one is the [scm-activity-plugin](https://bitbucket.org/sdorra/scm-activity-plugin) which shows the latest activity (changesets) from your repositories. Both plugin requires SCM-Manager version 1.8 or newer.
