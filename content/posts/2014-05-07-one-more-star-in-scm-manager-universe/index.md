The third release of SCM-Manager Universe is available now. It extends the appliance by a SingleSignOn (SSO) solution based on the tool “Central Authentication Service” (CAS). Thanks to this system you can use the connected tools without repeating login requests, because the tools are authenticating against CAS, which in turn validates users against your authentication server (e.g. LDAP or Active Directory). For example you log in to SCM-Manager, and after that you can use Jenkins, SonarQube and Bugzilla without providing your login credentials once again.
