Good news, we made it. Before running out of numbers for our release candidates, we finally released version 2.0.0 of SCM-Manager. 

It took us nearly 10 years, over 10,000 commits and 8 release canidates.

# Whatâ€™s new

TODO text Since 1.60

## Frontend

The most obviously change is the new ui. We have recreated the whole UI from scratch. The 1.x UI was based on ExtJS, which worked great, but it does not look modern. With ExtJS it was possible to override any UI element from a plugin. This is great in terms of extensibility, but not really maintainable if you want to evolve the core. The new frontend stack is entirely based on React and Bulma and it has well-defined extension points, which makes the whole side easier to maintain. Enough words about the ui, here are some screenshots from the new ui.

## Plugins

We created a whole new package format for the plugins, which should fix all of the problems with v1 plugin installations. With the new format, only a single file has to be fetched and the server can restart on its own. And besides 25 of well known plugins available for v1, we have great new plugins for you:

### Review Plugin

With the review plugin you can implement a branched based peer review process: Develop new features on a branch, create a pull request where you describe your changes, and let a peer developer inspect these changes. You can write comments for the whole pull request, for single files and even for changed lines. Finally, you can merge the branches inside SCM-Manager. With the help of the CI plugin you can enforce complex workflows to ensure, only working code will be released.

### Editor Plugin

Ever wanted to make a small change in a repository? Like updating a README or uploading a new file? Now you can use the editor plugin to do so.

### SSH Plugin

You have enough from constant entering your username and password? No problem use the SSH Plugin with a SSH-Key.

### Landingpage Plugin (MySCM)

Sometimes it gets hard to keep track of important things. This is, where our new landingpage plugin comes into play: On a single page you can see your tasks, latest events and relevant data like your favorite repositories.

### OpenAPI Plugin

We are somewhat proud of the new level 3 REST API, and we would like to enable you to use it. Instead of writing a big documentation we give you a plugin to explore all the possibilities.

## Permissions

The permission model of SCM-Manager v1 was limited to the distinction between admins and users and roles you could assign for single repositories. With version 2 you can now assign fine grained permissions, both globally and repository specific. But this definitely is a topic for another document.

## Repository URLS

One of the most annoying things in v1 is the fact, that the urls for the repository ui and the one for the checkout/clone are different. With SCM-Manager 2 we wanted to change this. In order to fix that problem we had to introduce a limitation for the repository names. In v1 it was possible to create repositories with any depth (a/b/c). This makes it really hard to add an ui to the same path, because it is nearly impossible to differentiate between the name of the repository and technical routes. So we decided to introduce namespaces. In SCM-Manager 2, a repository identifier consists of two parts: the namespace and the name of the repository. The namespace can be auto generated with a strategy (e. g. current username, year, repository type) or can be chosen freely.

This change fixes the routing problem and removes the technical ids from the urls (which were nearly omnipresent in v1). For your convenience, we tried to create redirects from the old urls to the new ones if you migrate from v1 to v2.

## Versioning

You may have noticed a little detail in our new version number: We moved from 1.60 to 2.0.0, that is, from now on we use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
