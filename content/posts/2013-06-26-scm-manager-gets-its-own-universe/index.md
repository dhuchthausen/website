The virtual appliance SCM-Manager Universe, developed by my partner TRIOLOGY, is a Linux based virtual machine, which comes with a bundle of ready to use open source software components. It has a comprehensive documentation, including tutorials, a sample project and tool descriptions. All of the software development tools authenticate against a central LDAP server with reasonable default users and groups configuration. The appliance has also a simple backup mechanism, which allows regular backups of all relevant files.
