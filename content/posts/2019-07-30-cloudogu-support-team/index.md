Some time ago a vigorous involvement with SCM-Manager was announced in the [Cloudogu blog](https://cloudogu.com/en/blog/scm-manager-collaboration). In the first step, Cloudogu joined the development of SCM-Manager 2. Now, as the second step, Cloudogu assigned a team to actively help with the support for SCM-Manager. The team will do what a support team does: answer your questions, evaluate and fix reported bugs and feature requests.

Because we don’t want to oversee your questions and reports, we decided to centralize the support channels. These are the channels that we will be watching from now on:

- [GoogleGroup / Mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scmmanager): Use this forum for general questions.
- [Issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/sdorra/scm-manager/issues): Report bugs and create feature requests here.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scmmanager): Feel free to use Stackoverflow for your questions, but make sure to use the tag ‘scmmanager’.

If you try to get in touch with the support team using another way, we might not reply. To prevent these situations, we will disable other options for example by deactivating the comment function here on the website.

We are looking forward to hearing from you.
